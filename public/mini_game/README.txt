	"Kuafu decided to chase and catch the Sun, He followed the Sun from the East to the West.
	While he was passing thru the river of Wei (a branch of the yellow river), he drank the 
	entire river to quench his burning thirst. However, the great river was unable to satiate
	his need for water. He ran on towards north, eventually died of thirst and exhaustion."
